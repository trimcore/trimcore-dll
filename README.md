*TRIMCORE.DLL*
# TRIM CORE SOFTWARE Utility DLL

The library is part of software management services and is distributed along with certain software made by our company. It provides various standalone facilities, coordination utilities and interface towards said management services, albeit those are not required to be installed or running.

Publicly documented interfaces are intended to remain backward compatible, i.e. the DLL can be updated separately from the software using it.
